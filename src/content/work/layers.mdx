  Layers is a customizable beauty company. Drawing from the visual vernacular of both soil layers and skin layers, each box pattern is uniquely generated based on the customer’s personalized formula.

  A custom algorithm was created to map each user’s data into a Bézier curve, generating a one-of-a-kind layered design. The width of each layer reflects the proportion of organic ingredients in the product, while the curves themselves are derived from the user's name, translated through ASCII code. The grid design on the box adapts responsively to the size of the package. Multiple color options are available, allowing for variety across different product lines.

  for example, here preferring in-person work increases gravitational pull.
