title: "XR"
description: |
  XR’s brand identity is built around purposeful momentum and performance, combining modernist aesthetics with influences from fashion, skincare, and film culture. In collaboration with the design team, I developed a custom generative tool to bring this vision to life, allowing the XR team to easily create dynamic text gradients in motion. The system uses letterforms and language itself as design objects, creating patterns that reflect the brand’s forward-moving, intelligent nature. The tool generates these patterns in line with the carefully crafted visual language, which includes a softened, middle-weight “X” mark that breathes and shifts as it animates.

  The generative design system we created leverages these foundational elements, such as the subtle weight shifts in the logo and the use of modern typography, to produce motion-based patterns that emphasize XR’s strategic direction. By focusing on scalability and flexibility, the tool ensures that XR’s identity can evolve with minimal input, while maintaining consistency across applications.
