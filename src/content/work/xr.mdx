  Collaborated with a group of designers and developers on designing and developing the new website for New Museum. I mainly contribute to the design and development of the membership and ticketing systems, while ensuring accessibility guidelines were met throughout the website.

  The site serves as a critical touchpoint for The New Museum, and beyond refining core functions like ticket purchases and event calendars, the team worked to enhance its capacity to provide context for a wide range of audiences.

  For example, the new exhibition page not only showcases details about each specific show, but also surfaces supplemental resources, upcoming related events, and similar works from the museumâ€™s digital archive. This approach aims to make contemporary art more accessible and engaging, whether users are physically visiting the museum or exploring from anywhere in the world.

  The website uses a lot of different vibrant color combinations, and houses
  many images so it was important to ensure that the site is accessible to all
  users. The site was built using a modular design system, which allows for easy
  updates and changes in the future.
