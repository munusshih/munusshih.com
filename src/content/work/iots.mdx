title: "Image of The Studio: Data Designer"
description: |
  The Data Designer is a mobile-first interactive survey that I designed and co-developed for the 2023 AIGA National Conference in New York.

  Participants would go through a series of questions about their experiences
  and opinions on the current design landscape, and generate a bespoke animated data visualizations about their view on design and share with friends. Building on the original Image of the Studio identity from ten years ago, the tool adds a touch of science-lab flair, using interactive surveys to create a personalized journey through today’s design landscape.

  Since its debut, hundreds of graphic designers have engaged with the website. The subpage Data Visualizer providing a real-time interactive view of all collected data, offering unique insights into the breadth and depth of the NYC design world.
