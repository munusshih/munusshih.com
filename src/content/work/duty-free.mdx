title: "Duty Free"
description: |
  Duty Free is a speculative e-commerce site that unpacks how our labor as designers is valued under capitalism.  Instead of money, time is the main form of currency, offered in units of hours, as inspired by time-banking within solidarity economies.

  Participants browse design services on an iPad, customizing offerings based on detailed attributes that determine the time required for each task. When someone reaches the checkout flow of the website, they are then prompted to identify what they can offer in exchange. These needs could look like cooking us a meal, giving us a ride, or facilitating a difficult conversation on our behalf. The participants receive a printed receipt of their transaction at the end of their experience.
