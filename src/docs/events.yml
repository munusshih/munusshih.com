    We believe that it is important to bring those people in, and believe that apart from the traditional computer science teaching method, there is another kind of technology education that is more suitable for beginners and approachable.
  excerpt: |
    In collaboration with Taiwanese artist Yangching Lu, begin Contour is a teaching practicum. We invited many Taiwanese middle school teachers, art educators, experimental educators, designers, and creative coders to collectively reimagine creative technology through a more beginner-friendly and approachable technology education.
