    Does the shape of home gradually changes through each departure?
  excerpt: "Partnered with local Hakka artists Yalan Wen and researcher I-hao Liao to uncover the story of Hakka soldiers who were forced to join the military during WWII, we built a participatory migration database. People can input when, where, and why they moved, along with their emotions or the stories into the system. These data are later sent as morse code to a physical installation in Guanxi, presented in continuously flashing telegraphic signals."
